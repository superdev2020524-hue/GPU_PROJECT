I will now store the plans you will be implementing next in the folder mentioned above.  In this folder, I will create .TXT files to ensure continuity in case you forget the session, including files for my questions, files documenting the results you provided, files recording any errors that occurred during the process, and files documenting only the successful steps. This will allow me to avoid repeating errors and achieve the desired results more efficiently when I review the folder later. It will also allow you to refer to what you have already done and the resources you need to continue. I will upload the next set of objectives for this stage.  Initially, we will discuss the direction together, and once the direction is decided, I will provide implementation instructions. Please let me know when you are ready. Before that, please analyze the entire project to see how far we have progressed. You don't need to write a full analysis report, but you can briefly summarize it in the register mentioned above for your reference. Please let me know when you are ready.
