# UNDERSTANDING AND APPROACH DOCUMENT
**Created:** 2026-02-08 00:23:51
**Purpose:** Confirm understanding of requirements before proceeding with investigation

## YOUR REQUEST SUMMARY

You have designated the `step2_test/` folder as the central repository for:
- All information and storage for second-stage review tasks
- Comprehensive investigation reports
- Session logs
- All files needed for the second-stage review

## MY ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITIES

### 1. **Comprehensive Investigation**
   - Investigate ALL files in the current work path (`/home/david/Downloads/gpu/`)
   - Analyze the codebase, documentation, scripts, and configuration files
   - Understand the current state of the project
   - Identify relationships between components

### 2. **Report Generation**
   - Create a comprehensive investigation report
   - Store the report in `step2_test/` folder
   - Document findings, architecture, dependencies, and current status

### 3. **Session Logging**
   - Create and maintain a session log file in `step2_test/` folder
   - Record all interactions, decisions, and progress
   - Track recommendations and confirmations

### 4. **Assistance Methodology**
   - Understand your goals and intentions
   - Provide recommendations based on available resources
   - **Always provide reasoning** for each recommendation
   - **Wait for your confirmation** before implementing anything
   - **Never proceed independently** without your explicit approval

### 5. **Workflow**
   - You review my recommendations
   - You confirm if they align with your direction
   - Only then do I receive implementation instructions
   - No autonomous thinking or proceeding on my own

## PROJECT CONTEXT (Initial Understanding)

Based on initial exploration, this appears to be:
- **Platform:** XCP-ng with NVIDIA H100 80GB PCIe GPUs
- **Orchestration:** Apache CloudStack (target)
- **Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Pool and Priority Metadata System
- **Key Components:**
  - vGPU stub devices
  - GPU mediation daemon
  - Priority-based queuing system
  - IOMMU security implementation
  - VM management and configuration

## NEXT STEPS (Pending Your Confirmation)

1. **Investigation Phase:**
   - Systematic file-by-file analysis
   - Code structure examination
   - Documentation review
   - Dependency mapping
   - Current implementation status assessment

2. **Report Creation:**
   - Comprehensive investigation report
   - Architecture overview
   - Component relationships
   - Current state assessment
   - Identified gaps or issues

3. **Session Log Setup:**
   - Initialize session log file
   - Begin recording all interactions

## CONFIRMATION REQUIRED

Please confirm:
- [ ] This understanding is correct
- [ ] You want me to proceed with the comprehensive investigation
- [ ] The `step2_test/` folder is the correct location for all outputs
- [ ] The workflow (recommend → confirm → implement) is acceptable

**I am ready to proceed once you confirm this understanding.**
