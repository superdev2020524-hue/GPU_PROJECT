                    SUCCESS LOG
                    Configuration & Management Interface (Step 2-4)
================================================================================

Purpose: Record ONLY verified, working steps that others can follow
Principle: If it's not verified to work, it doesn't go in this file

================================================================================
                        VERIFIED STEPS
================================================================================

STEP 0: Planning and Documentation Setup
----------------------------------------
Date: January 11, 2026
Status: ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE

What Was Done:
--------------
1. Created REGISTRY_CORE_GOALS.txt with absolute requirements
2. Created ROLE_AND_METHODOLOGY.txt defining working approach
3. Created STATUS.txt for tracking progress
4. Created SUCCESS_LOG.txt (this file) for verified steps

Verification:
--------------
✅ All documents created and reviewed
✅ Registry defines clear, unchangeable requirements
✅ Role document defines working methodology
✅ Status tracking in place

Files Created:
--------------
- /home/david/Downloads/gpu/step2(2-4)/REGISTRY_CORE_GOALS.txt
- /home/david/Downloads/gpu/step2(2-4)/ROLE_AND_METHODOLOGY.txt
- /home/david/Downloads/gpu/step2(2-4)/STATUS.txt
- /home/david/Downloads/gpu/step2(2-4)/SUCCESS_LOG.txt

Notes:
------
This step establishes the foundation for all future work. The registry
document serves as the absolute source of truth and cannot be changed
without explicit authorization.
