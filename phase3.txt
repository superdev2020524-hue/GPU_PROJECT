Phase 3 Plan
Advanced Scheduling, Isolation & Operational Controls
Executive Overview
Phase 3 builds on the validated foundation established in Phases 1 and 2. Phase 1 proved
feasibility (VM → mediator → CUDA execution). Phase 2 introduced structured scheduling and
PCI/MMIO-based communication. Phase 3 focuses on evolving the system into a policy-driven
GPU virtualization layer suitable for multi-tenant environments.
1. Architectural Continuity
The PCI/MMIO communication model, mediator-managed execution path, queue-based
scheduling architecture, CLI interface, and database configuration layer remain intact. Phase 3
enhances enforcement and control without altering the transport layer.
2. Priority-Aware Scheduling
Introduces weighted priority scheduling (High / Medium / Low tiers) with FIFO ordering
within equal priority. Aging mechanisms prevent starvation. Scheduling weights configurable
via CLI.
3. Resource Isolation & Protection Controls
Implements token bucket rate limiting, queue depth limits, execution watchdog monitoring, and
quarantine mode to prevent monopolization and ensure system stability.
4. Pool-Based Resource Segmentation
Logical VM grouping into independent pools (e.g., Pool A → GPU A, Pool B → GPU B). Each pool
maintains independent scheduling queues and isolation boundaries.
5. Observability & Runtime Metrics
Per-VM metrics include GPU utilization, queue depth, latency (avg / p95 / p99), context
switches, and error rates. Metrics are exposed via CLI and structured logging, with optional
Prometheus integration.
6. Administrative Control Layer (CLI Expansion)
Extends vgpu-admin CLI for VM registration, pool assignment, priority configuration, rate
limiting, and scheduler tuning. Enables centralized operational control.
7. Validation & Testing Plan
Validation includes 7–10 concurrent VMs, mixed priority workloads, AI inference validation,
stress testing, isolation checks, and sustained load testing.
8. Production Readiness Position
Upon completion, the system will be suitable for controlled production deployment with fair
scheduling, isolation controls, administrative governance, and operational transparency.
Conclusion
Phase 3 transitions the project from a validated prototype into a scalable, policy-driven GPU
virtualization layer, establishing a strong foundation for long-term GPU infrastructure
