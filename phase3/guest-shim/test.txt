I'm trying to use a self-developed PCI passthrough VGPU. In other words, I changed the kernel-level settings of XCP-NG to block the host's GPU 100 from connecting to the VM, installed NVIDIA on the host to manage the H100, managed the GPU first through CUDA commands, built a PCI VPGU-STUB device that can receive this mediator layer, and instantiated it in the VM through QEMU. At this time, I faked the properties of this VGPU-STUB device to look like H100, and it is already appearing as NVIDIA in the VM through the LSPCI command. What I have to do is make the VGPU-STUB device that appears in this LSPCI look like a GPU in the VM, so that OLLAMA thinks this VGPU-STUB is a GPU and gives a command here, and this VGPU-STUB sends data to the host in MMIO mode to the MEDIATOR, and this MEDIATOR requests work to the actual GPU H100 of the host, and it is returned to the VM. My goal is to send the result to VGPU-STUB and make OLLAMA think that the result came from the GPU.
