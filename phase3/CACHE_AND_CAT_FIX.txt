CACHE AND CAT FIX - Additional Safety Improvements
==================================================

Problem:
--------
Even after removing strstr(), `cat` was still crashing. Analysis showed:
1. We weren't explicitly checking for common system tools like `cat`, `bash`, `sh`
2. We were caching negative results, which could cause issues if cached incorrectly

Solution:
---------
1. Added explicit checks for common system tools:
   - `cat` (3 chars: 'c' 'a' 't')
   - `bash` (4 chars: 'b' 'a' 's' 'h')
   - `sh` (2 chars: 's' 'h')

2. Made caching more conservative:
   - Only cache positive results (when ollama is found)
   - Never cache negative results - always recheck for non-ollama processes
   - This prevents any possibility of caching a wrong value

Changes Made:
-------------
File: phase3/guest-shim/libvgpu_cuda.c

1. Added system process checks (lines ~1232-1242):
   - Check for 'cat'
   - Check for 'bash'
   - Check for 'sh'

2. Modified caching logic (lines ~1307-1315):
   - Only cache if result == 1 (ollama found)
   - Never cache result == 0 (non-ollama)
   - Always recheck for non-ollama processes

Rationale:
----------
- Whitelist approach: Only intercept ollama, everything else is excluded
- Conservative caching: Only cache positive matches, never negative
- Explicit exclusions: Common system tools explicitly checked
- Safety first: Default to not intercepting if anything is uncertain

Testing:
--------
After this fix:
1. Build the library
2. Deploy to VM
3. Configure preload
4. Test `cat /etc/ld.so.preload` (should work)
5. Test `lspci` (should work)
6. Test `bash` commands (should work)
7. Test SSH (should work)
8. Test other system commands (should work)

Expected Results:
-----------------
- No segmentation faults
- `cat` works after preload
- `lspci` works after preload
- `bash`/`sh` work after preload
- SSH remains functional
- System commands work normally
- VM does not crash
- Only ollama processes are intercepted

Status:
-------
- Code fixed and ready
- Waiting for working VM to test
- Previous VM (test-8) crashed during testing
- Need console access to remove preload or new VM
