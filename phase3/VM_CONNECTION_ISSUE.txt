VM CONNECTION ISSUE - test@10.25.33.15
================================================================================

STATUS: Cannot connect to VM - authentication failing

ISSUE:
- SSH connection attempts result in "Permission denied"
- Password prompt appears but authentication fails
- VM is pingable (network connectivity OK)

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. Password might be incorrect
2. VM might not be fully set up yet
3. SSH service might need configuration
4. User account might need password reset

ATTEMPTS MADE:
- Direct SSH connection
- pexpect with password handling
- Multiple password prompt handling
- All result in "Permission denied"

NEXT STEPS:
1. Verify password is correct: Calvin@123
2. Check if VM is fully initialized
3. Verify SSH service is running on VM
4. Try connecting manually to verify credentials
5. If password is wrong, reset it or get correct password

FILES READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:
✓ libvgpu_cuda.c (with all fixes: SSH safety, dlsym order, whitelist cache)
✓ cuda_transport.c
✓ cuda_transport.h
✓ gpu_properties.h
✓ cuda_protocol.h

All files are ready locally and will be copied once VM connection is established.
