                    PHASE 2: SESSION LOG
================================================================================
Purpose: Track all work sessions with timestamps and activities
Format: Date | Session # | Activities | Outcomes | Issues

================================================================================
SESSION 1 - January 24, 2026
================================================================================

Time Started: [To be filled during session]
Goal: Prepare for Phase 2 implementation and review Phase 1 success

Activities:
-----------
1. ✅ Reviewed Phase 1 completion (vGPU stub device)
   - Device successfully built and integrated into QEMU
   - Visible in guest VMs via lspci
   - Properties (pool_id, priority, vm_id) working via MMIO
   - Complete guide documented (1009 lines)

2. ✅ Created documentation structure for Phase 2:
   - PHASE2_STATUS.txt      (Status tracker)
   - SESSION_LOG.txt        (This file)
   - SUCCESSFUL_STEPS.txt   (Confirmed working steps only)
   - ERRORS_LOG.txt         (Error tracking and solutions)
   - COMPLETE_GUIDE.txt     (Final beginner guide - to be created)

3. ⏳ Reviewed REPORT1.TXT requirements:
   - Phase 1 Requirement 1: vGPU stub device ✅ COMPLETED
   - Phase 1 Requirement 2: VM↔Dom0 communication ⏳ NEXT
   - Phase 1 Requirement 3: CUDA execution ⏳ PENDING
   - Phase 1 Requirement 4: Two-VM concurrency ⏳ PENDING
   - Phase 1 Requirement 5: Project report ⏳ IN PROGRESS

Key Decisions:
-------------
1. Use NFS for VM↔Dom0 communication (per REPORT1.TXT design)
2. Implement per-VM command/response files for concurrency
3. Priority queues: High → Medium → Low, FIFO within priority
4. Non-preemptive execution for Phase 2
5. Test CUDA in Dom0 first; fallback to worker VM if needed

Next Session Goals:
------------------
1. Set up NFS shared directory between Dom0 and VMs
2. Create basic mediation daemon skeleton
3. Create VM client skeleton
4. Test basic file-based communication

Issues Encountered:
------------------
None yet - preparation phase
