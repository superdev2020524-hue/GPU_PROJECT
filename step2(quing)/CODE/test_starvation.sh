# Test script to verify Pool B doesn't starve when Pool A is busy
#
# This test demonstrates that the round-robin scheduler prevents starvation
#
# Expected behavior:
# - Pool A VM sends many requests
# - Pool B VM sends few requests
# - Pool B should NOT wait for all Pool A requests to complete
# - Both pools should see responses interleaved
