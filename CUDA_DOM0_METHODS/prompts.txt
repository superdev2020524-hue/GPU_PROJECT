You are a senior virtualization + GPU systems engineer with deep expertise in:
- XCP-ng / Xen hypervisor internals
- NVIDIA CUDA runtime and driver model
- GPU mediation, passthrough, and host-only CUDA execution
- dom0 GPU access in Xen-based systems

Context:
I am running XCP-ng (Xen-based hypervisor). I ABSOLUTELY MUST execute CUDA code on the HOST (dom0) only.
I do NOT want:
- GPU passthrough to guests
- vGPU
- CUDA inside a VM
- Any cloud or container workaround

Goal:
Run basic CUDA operations (e.g., vector addition) using the host CUDA runtime directly on the physical GPU while XCP-ng is installed.

Problem:
- CUDA device enumeration partially works (GPU info can be queried)
- Any real CUDA kernel execution fails with errors like:
  "operation not supported"
  "command not supported"
- This failure happens at STEP 1 of the provided project_detail.txt
- I have already tried:
  - Changing IOMMU settings (iommu=pt, disabling iommu)
  - Modifying Xen boot parameters
  - Patch-based approaches referenced in Xen / CUDA docs
  - Different NVIDIA driver versions
None of these worked.

Task:
1. Search globally (mailing lists, GitHub issues, NVIDIA dev forums, Xen Project docs, XCP-ng discussions).
2. Identify whether **host-side CUDA execution in dom0 is actually supported** under XCP-ng/Xen.
3. If unsupported, explain *exactly why* (driver model, BAR access, interrupt handling, memory pinning, etc.).
4. If supported or partially supported:
   - Provide the exact working configuration:
     - Xen version
     - XCP-ng version
     - NVIDIA driver version
     - Kernel version
     - Required Xen boot params
     - Required NVIDIA kernel module flags
5. If kernel execution is blocked by Xen:
   - Identify the precise technical blocker
   - State whether it is:
     - A hard architectural limitation
     - A missing mediation layer
     - A known NVIDIA/Xen incompatibility
6. Propose the ONLY viable host-side CUDA solution paths (if any), such as:
   - Running CUDA before Xen fully claims the GPU
   - Using a minimal dom0 without XCP-ng toolstack interference
   - Using a mediation daemon approach (VM → shared memory → dom0 → CUDA)
7. Clearly state if my requirement is **fundamentally impossible**, and if so:
   - Cite authoritative sources
   - Explain what NVIDIA + Xen would need to change to make it possible

Important constraints:
- Do NOT suggest VM CUDA, Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud GPUs
- Do NOT suggest passthrough or vGPU
- Do NOT give generic CUDA or Xen explanations
- Focus ONLY on making host CUDA work under XCP-ng, or proving conclusively that it cannot

Deliverables:
- Clear yes/no feasibility answer
- Root-cause technical explanation
- Verified references (forums, issues, docs)
- Exact configuration or definitive impossibility proof
