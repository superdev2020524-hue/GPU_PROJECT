                    Track completion status of each method
================================================================================

LAST UPDATED: [Update this when methods are completed]

METHOD STATUS SUMMARY:
----------------------

[✓] Method 1-12: Initial Troubleshooting
    Status: COMPLETED
    Result: FAILED - CUDA detects virtualization via /proc/cpuinfo
    Date: Previous session

[✓] Method 13: LD_PRELOAD Interception
    Status: COMPLETED
    Result: FAILED - CUDA uses CPUID directly, bypasses file I/O
    Date: Previous session
    Notes: Successfully filtered /proc/cpuinfo but CUDA still detects virtualization

[✓] Method 14: Binary Patching
    Status: COMPLETED
    Result: FAILED - Causes segfaults, too risky
    Date: Previous session
    Notes: Found CPUID at 0x25a26f, tried multiple patches, all caused issues

[✓] Method 26: Xen CPUID Masking Parameters
    Status: COMPLETED
    Result: NOT AVAILABLE - Xen doesn't have CPUID masking parameters
    Date: Previous session

[ ] Method 15: Namespace/Container Isolation
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: MEDIUM
    File: 15_NAMESPACE_ISOLATION.txt
    Notes: May not work if CUDA uses CPUID directly

[ ] Method 16: Kernel Module to Intercept CPUID
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: HIGH (Most viable)
    File: 16_KERNEL_MODULE_CPUID_INTERCEPT.txt
    Notes: Requires kernel module development

[ ] Method 17: CUDA Package Manager Installation
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: MEDIUM
    File: 17_CUDA_PACKAGE_MANAGER.txt
    Notes: Easy to try, low risk

[ ] Method 18: Modify Xen Source Code
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW (Very high complexity)
    Notes: Requires Xen source modification and recompilation

[ ] Method 19: CUDA Runtime Wrapper Library
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: MEDIUM
    Notes: Complex, requires deep CUDA API knowledge

[ ] Method 20: CUDA Debug/Development Builds
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: May not exist

[ ] Method 21: CUDA Compatibility Mode
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: May not exist

[ ] Method 22: FUSE Filesystem
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: MEDIUM
    File: 22_FUSE_FILESYSTEM.txt
    Notes: May not work if CUDA uses CPUID directly

[ ] Method 23: ptrace Memory Modification
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW (Very complex, high risk)
    Notes: Requires reverse engineering

[ ] Method 24: NVIDIA Enterprise CUDA
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: May require licensing

[ ] Method 25: CUDA via RPC
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: Not true local CUDA

[ ] Method 27: Docker/Container with GPU
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: May not work if detection is at kernel level

[ ] Method 28: Binary Search/Replace
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW (High risk)
    Notes: Similar to Method 14

[ ] Method 29: WSL2-style GPU Passthrough
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: LOW
    Notes: May not be applicable to XCP-ng

[ ] Method 30: Contact NVIDIA/XCP-ng Support
    Status: NOT STARTED
    Priority: MEDIUM
    Notes: Worth trying for official solution

RECOMMENDED ORDER:
-----------------
1. Method 16: Kernel Module (HIGH PRIORITY)
2. Method 17: CUDA Package Manager (Easy)
3. Method 15: Namespace Isolation (Medium)
4. Method 22: FUSE Filesystem (Medium)
5. Method 30: Contact Support (Easy, may help)
6. Others as needed

CURRENT FOCUS: Method 16 (Kernel Module)
